## Problem

My friends like anime way too much . . . they decided that to give me an encoded [message](files/message.txt), but I can't solve it because I'm not a weeb!

## Hint

railguns are cool

## Write-Up

After some Googling, you find something called the Rail-Fence cipher.

Decrypt it with:

Guess and check the key to get `railgunsarethebesteasyctfl3v3l5esp3rs`

flag = `easyctf{l3v3l5esp3rs}`
