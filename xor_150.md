# XOR (150)

## Problem

This string has been encrypted using XOR!

`message = " $6<&1#><*\x1a!$2\x22\x1a,\x1a- $7!\x1a<*0\x1a),. !\x1a=*78"`

## Hint

What could the key be? Here's a hint: it was encrypted 3 times.

## Write-Up

Almost every flag starts with `easyctf{`, so this led me to check that as the key first.

After decrypting it like that, you get the answer `EEEEEEE`, so now we used that instead.

Decrypt ` $6<&1#><*\x1a!$2\x22\x1a,\x1a- $7!\x1a<*0\x1a),. !\x1a=*78` with key `EEEEEEE`, and get `easyctf{yo=t$daw=ww=t$i=t$heard=t$you=t$liked=t$xor}`

Now just use common sense and replace each `=t$` with an underscore, and you get `easyctf{yo_daw=ww_i_heard_you_liked_xor}`.
All that's left to do is replace the one anomaly with a "g", giving us the flag.

flag = `easyctf{yo_dawg_i_heard_you_liked_xor}`
