## Problem

A lonely little text file wants to play a game: `/problems/owner`.

## Hint

Google is always your friend.

## Write-Up

Navigate to `/problems/owner` and type `ls` to see what we're dealing with.
Type `cat file.txt` to open the file.

You have to find the owner and group of the file to continue.
Like the hint says, if you don't already know how to do this, Google it!
This will tell you to use `ls -l file.txt`
This will bring up all sorts of information, including the owner and group!
